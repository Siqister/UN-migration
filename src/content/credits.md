This is a visualization of the global migration "stock", based on the United Nations Global Migration Database. The original data, as well as important data considerations, can be accessed [here](https://esa.un.org/unmigration/).

This project is designed and created by [Siqi Zhu](http://www.siqizhu.net), and is intended as both a technical visualization exercise and an exploration of global migration.
